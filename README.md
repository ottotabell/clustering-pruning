# Clustering and Pruning in Causal Data Fusion

This repository contains the R-codes that were used in obtaining a majority of the causal effect identifying formulas in the examples of the paper Clustering and Pruning in Causal Data Fusion (Tabell, et al., 2025). The R-package do-search (Tikka et al., 2023) was used in the examples.
